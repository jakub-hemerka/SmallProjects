# MP3 Playlist Class

[Original Python version](https://www.101computing.net/mp3-playlist-class/)

The aim of this challenge is to implement a Class to maintain an MP3 Playlist. This class could be used when developing the software for a music App on a smartphone or an mp3 player.

This MP3 playlist will be stored as a queue of MP3 tracks. When new tracks are being added to the playlist, they are enqueued at the end of the playlist. The key features that we will implement within this class are the ability to:

- Load a playlist from a text file
- Display all the tracks from the playlist
- Enqueue an MP3 to the playlist
- Remove an MP3 from the playlist
- Save a playlist on a text file
- Shuffle all the songs in the playlist
- Count the number of tracks in the playlist
- Calculate the total duration of the playlist
- Empty/Reset the playlist
- Check if the playlist is empty
