# Egg Code Stamp Decoder

[Original Python version](https://www.101computing.net/egg-code-stamp-decoder/)

Did you know that in the UK (and also in most European countries), the eggs you buy in a shop must be stamped with a code that can help you find out more about how and where your eggs were produced. This code is helpful to distinguish organic and free range eggs from eggs from more industrial production (e.g. barn or caged hen eggs).

For this challenge you will need to write a program that:

- Takes one input from the end-user: the code as it appear on a stamped egg. (Just the code, not the Best Before Date)
- Use this code to output the farming method this egg originated from: (Organic, Free range, Barn or Cage)
- Output the country of Origin: e.g.:
  - UK: United Kingdom
  - NL: Netherlands
  - FR: France
  - BE: Belgium
  - DE: Germany
  - ES: Spain
- Output the farm/producer ID
