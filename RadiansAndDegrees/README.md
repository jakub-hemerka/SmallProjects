# Radians to Degrees Conversions

[Original Python version](https://www.101computing.net/radians-to-degrees-conversions/)

In this challenge we will write a program to convert an angle from degrees to radians or from radians to degrees based on the user’s choice. Our program will:
- Display a menu of options to the end user.
- Ask the end-user to choose an option from the menu.
- Ask the end-user to input an angle in the required unit.
- Calculate and output the angle in the alternative angle unit.
